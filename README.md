## Varieties
This repository has two branches:
* `develop` - basic react application boilerplate with minimum configuration
* `package/flowtyped-react` - react boilerplate with [flow](https://flow.org/) - static type checker

**Note**: currently this branches have different dependencies versions. ðŸ˜“ I will fix it later.
For example `develop` branch has `react-router v3` but `package/flowtyped-react` - `react-router v4`
